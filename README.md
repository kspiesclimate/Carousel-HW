# Carousel-HW

This was the 2nd HW for our Codepath class. Week 2!

I spent about 13 hours on this homework. The only piece I struggled to get to work consistently was the freeform paginated view controller... got paging to work in one version, but then somehow everything got sucked into the scroll view and I couldnt get it out. 

Then in another version, I was able to get things in different image views / scroll views, but scroll wouldnt work.

Otherwise the homework was good and went over smoothly..

The logic for log in was fun. Here's a gif!
